Usage: perl -w $0 <input FASTA> <output FASTA> <k> <n>

The required inputs are
    <input FASTA>   Input protein sequence file in FASTA format.
    <output FASTA>  Output protein sequence file in FASTA format.
    <k>             The size of k-mers whose distribution will be preserved.  This is 
                    equivalent to specifying a (k-1)-order Markov model.
    <n>             The number of random sequences per real sequence.

Input file may be compressed with gzip, and may be specified with or without the .gz 
extension.  Output file will be automatically compressed with gzip.

See the online manual for more info.
