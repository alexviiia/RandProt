Usage: perl -w $0 <input FASTA> <k>

The required inputs are
    <input FASTA>   Input protein sequence file in FASTA format.
    <k>             The size of k-mers to analyze.

Input file may be compressed with gzip, and may be specified with or without the .gz 
extension.  Analysis is printed to STDOUT.

See the online manual for more info.
